FridayNightLights
=================

An event management app.

I play hockey every Friday night with a bunch of friends.  We rent out a venue, split the costs and play.  The organizer spends time making sure we all have a good time and does it purely for the love of the game.  Right now, he tracks everything on an Excel spreadsheet.  I'm building this for him so he can more easily organize everything including the games, players, finances, and communications all from his phone.
