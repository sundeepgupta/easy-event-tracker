FridayNightLights
=================

I play hockey every Friday night with a bunch of friends.  We rent out a venue, split the costs and play.  One of the guys has the honourable job of organizing the entire thing "for the love of the game".  Right now, he tracks everything on an Excel spreadsheet.  He has an iPhone, so I want to build him something more convenient to use.  

There's a bunch of features I'd like to eventually build like automated tracking and management of payments, attendance confirmations, and other stuff.  But to start, I'm building an iPhone app that lets the organizer manually track everything.
